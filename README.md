# Retail Sales Excel Dashboard

This project is an end-to-end retail sales analysis built in **Excel Online**.  
It covers data cleaning, feature creation, PivotTables, and a final interactive-style dashboard that summarizes sales, profit, customer segments, and regional performance.

The goal was simple: start from a raw Excel file and turn it into something a manager could actually use to understand the business.
